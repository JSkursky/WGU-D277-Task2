                        Welcome to Pennsylvania, otherwise known as the "Commonwealth"! Located between the Mid-Atlantic
                        and Northeastern regions, our state is filled with a rich blend of history, culture, and natural
                        beauty. If you are exploring the western side of the state, you'll find the beautiful Appalachian
                        Mountains a great place to hike. If you venture over to the eastern side of the state, you can
                        explore cities like Philadelphia, which contains many important landmarks of American independence
                        (such as the Liberty Bell) and visit some of America's first establishments (America's first zoo,
                        hospital, and public library). There is always something to explore here! We hope you come to visit!
