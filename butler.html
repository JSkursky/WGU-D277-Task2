                Welcome to Butler!
                <br /><br />
                Butler is lesser-known for being the birthplace of the Jeep, and a hidden gem in the
                Greater Pittsburgh Area to live in and visit. Butler is located in Butler County in
                southwestern Pennsylvania. This suburban city was incorporated in 1918 and has a
                population of 12,873 as of the year 2024. Compared to the rest of the state's average
                household income of $80,996, Butler is below that number with $56,690 as the average.
                <br /><br />
                In the city of Butler, you can see plenty of the small-town history that makes this
                town a spot on the map worth visiting! Its residents celebrate being the birthplace
                of the Jeep by putting on the Bantam Jeep Heritage Festival each year and showcasing
                various makes and models of Jeeps. Fun fact - Jeep owners often leave rubber ducks on
                Jeeps they see to show that another Jeep owner liked their ride. What a creative way to
                show community! Other community-driven events include the Butler Fall Festival and the 
                Italian Festival, which offers incredible opportunities to experience the warmth and
                hospitality of this little town. Main Street in Butler is filled with many little
                Mom-and-Pop shops, where you can find everything from fresh-ground coffee to antiques
                to clothing and everything in between! Come visit us today!
