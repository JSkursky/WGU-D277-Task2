                Welcome to Philadelphia!
                <br /><br />
                Philadelphia has an incredibly rich history, dating back to the beginning of our country!
                It is located in southeastern Pennsylvania and is so large that it is part of 3 counties
                (Philadelphia County, Delaware County, and Montgomery County). In fact, it is the largest
                city in Pennsylvania, and the second largest on the East Coast. This urban city was incorporated
                in 1854 and has a population of 1,533,916 as of the year 2024. Compared to the rest of the state's
                average household income of $80,996, Philadelphia is above that number with $84,435 as the average.
                <br /><br />
                Philadelphia, often referred to as the birthplace of America, is filled with many historic landmarks
                and cultural points of interest. Millions of tourists annually come to visit the Liberty Bell and
                Independence Hall to see where our Founding Fathers helped create the foundations of our country.
                Philadelphia also offers many unique culinary experiences to choose from and prestigious centers for
                medicine and education, such as the University of Pennsylvania and the Thomas Jefferson University
                Hospital. This city also boasts many incredible art centers, such as the Philadelphia Museum of Art
                and the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts (where you can see world-class performances). Did you
                know it is also home to the first public library in the United States, founded by Benjamin Franklin
                in 1731? This city is filled with so many incredible pieces of history!
