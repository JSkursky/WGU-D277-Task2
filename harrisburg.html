                Welcome to Harrisburg!
                <br /><br />
                Nestled in Dauphin County in south-western Pennsylvania, Harrisburg is
                the state capitol. This urban city was incorporated in 1791 and has a
                population of 50,274 as of the year 2024. Compared to the rest of the
                state's average household income of $80,996, Harrisburg is below that
                number with $60,155 as the average.
                <br /><br />
                With Harrisburg being the state capitol, it has great significance in
                its historical and cultural scene. This is evident from its beautiful
                architecture, such as the State Capitol Building, and the many events
                that take place throughout the year celebrating diversity and community.
                There is also plenty to do with attractions such as the Whitaker Center
                for Science and the Arts, as well as the Riverfront Park along the
                Susquehanna River. There is always local food and music to partake in
                while  visiting this Pennsylvania centerpiece as well!
