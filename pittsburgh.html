                Welcome to Pittsburgh!
                <br /><br />
                Pittsburgh is best known for its steel production back in the 1900's (which
                is how it got its nickname of the "Steel City"), and today for its sports
                teams as well as being a great place to live in. Pittsburgh is located in
                Allegheny County in southwestern Pennsylvania. This urban city was incorporated
                in 1816 and has a population of 303,034 as of the year 2024. Compared to the
                rest of the state's average household income of $80,996, Pittsburgh is above
                that number with $87,811 as the average.
                <br /><br />
                Pittsburgh is a major center for culture, education, healthcare and technology,
                not only in the state, but throughout the country! It is home to world-class
                universities such as the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon, and
                boasts some of the best medical facilities in regards to heart and children's
                health. Pittsburgh has it all, from historic charm to modern amenities, which
                keeps its tourism industry booming. There are plenty of incredible dining options
                available in downtown Pittsburgh, with great views of the three rivers that flow
                around it (which is also why they call it the "Confluence"). Pittsburgh is home
                to 3 major sports teams (Hockey: Pittsburgh Penguins, Football: Pittsburgh Steelers,
                Baseball: Pittsburgh Pirates).
